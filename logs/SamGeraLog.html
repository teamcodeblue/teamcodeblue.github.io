Log for week Sep 12 - Sep 16:
2 Hours : Added some multi-threading to the desktop application to enable the model to completely run containerized 

1 Hours : Started talking with Scott to discuss ways to grab progression information from the topic modeler

2 Hours : Working with Scott to refine WMR3 and DD1 to be up to standards

1 Hours : Started to figure out how to write the proper code in Kivy in order to get a working progress bar, 
abandoning GPUtil statistics for now (this is less important) 
</pre>

<h3>Week of August 29</h3> 
<pre>
Log for week 2: Aug 29 - Sep 2

1 1/2 Hours : Team meetings, cleaning up and adding new Jira cards together,
and talking about feedback from TCH/ What needs done. 
	- Whole team included
	
3 Hours : Wireframe work for the desktop application, using Figma to get some good looking prototypes
	- Talked with Max and Scott about who does what and when it needs to be done (Next Friday) 
	
1 Hours : Doing some LaTeX work with the previous design document to fix some formatting issues (and things we left out) 

2 Hours : Reading Python Kivy documentation and messing around to see if what I'm prototyping in wireframes is reasonable 
	- This was used previously, still making sure it fits our goals 

Note : Still not reaching the ~10ish hours of work I want to be doing each week, hopefully next weeks log is better

<h3>Week of August 22 </h3>
<pre>
Log for week 1: Aug 22 - Aug 26

3 hours : Researching libraries for grabbing GPU Data so we can relay back usage statistics while our model performs 
learning tasks back to users in real time. Also researching libraries for visualizing this data. I am settling on GPUtil, no clear winner for 
visualization(May just use basic line graphing)

3 hours : Creating a website and compiling logs on that webiste for my teammates

Alec helped me on finding a web host
