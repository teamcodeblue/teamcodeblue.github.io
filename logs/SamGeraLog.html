Log for week Sep 19 - Sep 23: 
1 Hours: Talking with team during meetings regarding alpha demo 

2 Hours: I've been busy this week some i'm planning on spending this allotment of time to document and commit my code to the
main branch of the repository before the alpha demo. This includes majority of my UI code leftover from last semester for the Desktop APP

2 Hours: The container for the model on the desktop application was actually infringing upon UI updates for the desktop application. 
I've fixed this issue locally by reading some Kivy Documentation.

1 Hours : Doing some LaTeX work with the previous design document to fix some formatting issues (and things we left out)

<h3>Week of August 22 </h3>
<pre>
Log for week 1: Aug 22 - Aug 26

3 hours : Researching libraries for grabbing GPU Data so we can relay back usage statistics while our model performs 
learning tasks back to users in real time. Also researching libraries for visualizing this data. I am settling on GPUtil, no clear winner for 
visualization(May just use basic line graphing)

3 hours : Creating a website and compiling logs on that webiste for my teammates

Alec helped me on finding a web host
