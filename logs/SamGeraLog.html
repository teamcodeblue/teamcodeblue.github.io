<h3>Week of August 22 </h3>

Log for week 1: Aug 22 - Aug 26

3 hours : Researching libraries for grabbing GPU Data so we can relay back usage statistics while our model performs learning tasks back to users in real time. Also researching libraries for visualizing this data. I am settling on GPUtil, no clear winner for visualization(May just use basic line graphing)

3 hours : Creating a website and compiling logs on that webiste for my teammates

Alec helped me on finding a web host
