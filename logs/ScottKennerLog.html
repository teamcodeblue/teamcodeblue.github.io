    <h5>Week of September 30th Log</h5>
    <pre>
    Worked on the alpha demo this week, was busy with midterms in other classes to do much else as the week closed out. Looking into reformatting our
    JIRA ticketing and features list to better show what we're doing versus our current system of doing work according to jira and then realigning it 
    to the features rank list, see WMR short term goal NEW general:... for details.
    
     Overall ~4 hours of work was done on this class this week, will ramp up significantly next week.

    This week I coordinated various features to get started for polishing, etc such as P4.W2 etc with Max, Alec, and Sam. 
        
    Additionally Ive been working on the alpha demo due next week, ontop of doing research for the BERT model to help with efficacy of results

<h5>Week of September 16th Log</h5>
    <pre>
    This week I coordinated the DD1 resubmission, including recreated the system arhitecture diagram, revising the timeline twice (again, massive thanks
    to the professor for the feedback provided) and updating the feature list aswell.
    
    I was able to achieve these goals, and additionally coordinated 3 members of the team to get back into real development of the project. 
    
    I also looked into implementing the metrics, particuarly key stroke inputs by the user.
    
    Overall I spent ~10-11 hours on this project between DD1 resubmission, meetings, and keystroke metric reasearch

<h5>Week of September 9th Log</h5>
    <pre>
    This week I mainly coordinated the answers to the design document updates, timeline updates, user assignments, and made sure the wireframes were up to snuff
    with how they need to be for ideal user complete versions of our product. Some time was spent reading up and reasearching AI models in the news, and 
    looking at how BERT models are traditionally used. 
    
    Overall, I have probably done ~6-7 hours of work on this project this week.
