<h5>Week of September 16th Log</h5>
    <pre>
    This week I coordinated the DD1 resubmission, including recreated the system arhitecture diagram, revising the timeline twice (again, massive thanks
    to the professor for the feedback provided) and updating the feature list aswell.
    
    I was able to achieve these goals, and additionally coordinated 3 members of the team to get back into real development of the project. 
    
    I also looked into implementing the metrics, particuarly key stroke inputs by the user.
    
    Overall I spent ~10-11 hours on this project between DD1 resubmission, meetings, and keystroke metric reasearch

<h5>Week of September 9th Log</h5>
    <pre>
    This week I mainly coordinated the answers to the design document updates, timeline updates, user assignments, and made sure the wireframes were up to snuff
    with how they need to be for ideal user complete versions of our product. Some time was spent reading up and reasearching AI models in the news, and 
    looking at how BERT models are traditionally used. 
    
    Overall, I have probably done ~6-7 hours of work on this project this week.

    Coordinated with my classmates on wednesday to kickoff wireframes, additionally during the beginning of the week 
    I wrote down the inital answers to the design document questions we need to fill by the 9th.
    
    Main component this week has just been some light coordination, and beginning talks with Max and Alec to add bootstrap template to 
    the extension for the design work there that needs to be polished up.
