                    <h5>Week of  November 11th Log</h5>
    <pre>
This week mainly focused on getting the caching system up and running, which is going well enough but needs more polishing to handle edge cases such as 
when the user is calling it at odd times instead of return a generic error message (and handling multiple attempts at processing the model) overall spent
~6 hours on the project this week, planning on writing the brocheure over the weekend and getting the teams approval for submission.
    </pre>
            <h5>Week of  November 4th Log</h5>
    <pre>
This week I was not able to do much on my caching process to implement it due to a conflict of my work, and 2 other classes having serious homework/tests
this week that distracted me from my duties for the project, Next week appears to be quiter and as such I want to have p5 completed to satisfaction
with the caching system done. Total time spent is ~1-2hours between meetings and some light work on p5
    </pre>
        
        
    <h5>Week of October 28th Log</h5>
    <pre>
Main point this week was preparing for the beta demo, and particularly making sure p4 worked with what Sam was doing, as well as updating the DD to
make more sense with what was required (W1 and P1 swapping and the other metrics moving out. I made this descision since installing a keylogger 
onto a device isnt very feasible to either convince someone to do, nor is it particuarly easy to implement into the model at this point. Besides this
I also spent time with sam on P4 to make sure the UI was integrated properly into the extension, and creating a progress bar to go. Ontop of some small
additions to the exe (such as making sure the new UI works with it) and the resubmission of the user guide I spent roughly ~12 hours on the project 
this week.

    <h5>Week of October 21st Log</h5>
    <pre>
Finished creating the .exe file for the server/desktop application, and created the initial draft of the user guide (Installation, basic use, and legal)
though legal was removed since the professor clarified it wasnt nessesary. Overall spent ~12 hours on this project this week, mainly working through
pytorch not properly bundling in the py2exe and pyinstaller compilation (look at this command to compile the .exe! monsterous, thank goodness for stack overflow)

pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import=pytorch --collect-data torch --copy-metadata torch --copy-metadata tqdm --copy-metadata regex --copy-metadata sacremos es --copy-metadata requests --copy-metadata packaging --copy-metadata filelock --copy-metadata numpy --copy-metadata tokenizers --copy-metadata importlib_metadata --hidden-import="sklearn.utils._cython_blas" --hidden-import="sklearn.neighbors.typedefs" --hidden-import="sklearn.neighbors.quad_tree" --hidden-import="sklearn.tree" --hidden-import="sklearn.tree._utils" main.py

    <h5>Week of October 7th Log</h5>
    <pre>
Worked on reformatting the WMR and getting pyinstall to work to create a .msi file to launch the server/desktop app for feature P2
overall spent 8-9 hours this week on the project.

    <h5>Week of September 30th Log</h5>
    <pre>
    Worked on the alpha demo this week, was busy with midterms in other classes to do much else as the week closed out. Looking into reformatting our
    JIRA ticketing and features list to better show what we're doing versus our current system of doing work according to jira and then realigning it 
    to the features rank list, see WMR short term goal NEW general:... for details.
    
     Overall ~4 hours of work was done on this class this week, will ramp up significantly next week. 
    
    </pre>

    <h5>Week of September 23th Log</h5>
    <pre>
    This week I coordinated various features to get started for polishing, etc such as P4.W2 etc with Max, Alec, and Sam. 
        
    Additionally Ive been working on the alpha demo due next week, ontop of doing research for the BERT model to help with efficacy of results
    
    However, Overall I did not spend much time this week, about 4 hours total due to ramping assignments and midterms coming early next week.

<h5>Week of September 16th Log</h5>
    <pre>
    This week I coordinated the DD1 resubmission, including recreated the system arhitecture diagram, revising the timeline twice (again, massive thanks
    to the professor for the feedback provided) and updating the feature list aswell.
    
    I was able to achieve these goals, and additionally coordinated 3 members of the team to get back into real development of the project. 
    
    I also looked into implementing the metrics, particuarly key stroke inputs by the user.
    
    Overall I spent ~10-11 hours on this project between DD1 resubmission, meetings, and keystroke metric reasearch

<h5>Week of September 9th Log</h5>
    <pre>
    This week I mainly coordinated the answers to the design document updates, timeline updates, user assignments, and made sure the wireframes were up to snuff
    with how they need to be for ideal user complete versions of our product. Some time was spent reading up and reasearching AI models in the news, and 
    looking at how BERT models are traditionally used. 
    
    Overall, I have probably done ~6-7 hours of work on this project this week. 
    </pre>

<h4>Week of September 2nd Log</h3>
    <pre>
    Coordinated with my classmates on wednesday to kickoff wireframes, additionally during the beginning of the week 
    I wrote down the inital answers to the design document questions we need to fill by the 9th.
    
    Main component this week has just been some light coordination, and beginning talks with Max and Alec to add bootstrap template to 
    the extension for the design work there that needs to be polished up.
