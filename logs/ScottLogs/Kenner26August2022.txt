August 23rd: Tested positive for Covid on Wednesday which messed with my plans, did a 10 minute meeting with Alex and Max until I had to go lay down again.

August 26th: Did about 30 minutes of writing things and catching up with the Class, have been in communication this week with my classmates, wrote this log.
Still hanging on despite covid and recovering quickly! Big props to Sam for handling the website.
